The Envisaje project is an attempt to create an ImageJ2-based application
within the NetBeans Rich-Client Platform, using the Imagine image editor
as a foundation.

For more on ImageJ2, see: http://developer.imagej.net/
For more in Imagine, see: http://imagine.java.net/

Please note: As of February 2012, the Envisaje code is a few months
behind ImageJ2 core, and does not build.
